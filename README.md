Given an `n x n` array, return the array elements arranged from the outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

`array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]`
         
`snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]`

The main idea here is to traverse the 2D array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.
